# Product Management System

This is a product management system developed in Python using the [Flet](https://flet.dev/) framework. The application runs directly in the browser, allowing users to add, view, and manage products with an intuitive and responsive interface.

## Main Features

- **Product Registration**: Allows you to add new products with name, category, price, and stock quantity.
- **Product Viewing**: Displays a list of registered products in a table format, facilitating viewing and navigation.
- **Seamless Navigation**: A simplified navigation system hides the routes between pages, offering a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Flet**: A framework that simplifies web application development in Python without requiring deep knowledge of HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
- **Python**: Main language for building the applicationâ€™s logic and features.

## Requirements

- **Python:** Ensure Python is installed on your machine. The system was developed using Python 3.x.
  
## How to Run the Project

1. Install Flet (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install flet
    ```

2. Run the main project file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Access the application directly in your browser. The system is configured to run in the browser view (`WEB_BROWSER`).

## System Structure

The system includes three main pages:

1. **Home**: The homepage with an introduction to the system and basic usage instructions.
2. **Product Registration**: A page for adding new products to the system. Required fields: Product Name, Category, Price, and Quantity.
